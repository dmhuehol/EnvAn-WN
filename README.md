Basic description: MATLAB programs for warm nose sounding analysis

Repository contains functions and scripts in MATLAB used to analyze atmospheric soundings data containing melting layers, or "warm noses." Files were created by Daniel Hueholt at North Carolina State University, and contain any additional authorship information as needed.

Short descriptions of files:

Working:
FWOKXh6: current (5/26/17) version of MATLAB script to process soundings and surface observations data, and produce a variety of data visualizations. Refers to several of the functions in this repository. (Based on a script originally written by Megan Amanatides at NC State)
FWOKXskew: current (5/24/17) version of MATLAB function to create a skew-T chart given information from a soundings structure. (Adapted from code originally found at MIT OpenCourseware)
IGRAimpf: current (5/19/17) version of MATLAB function to create a structure of soundings data from raw Integrated Global Radiosonde Archive v1 .dat data. (Based on a function originally written by Megan Amanatides at NC State)
SkewT: current (5/24/17) version of MATLAB function to generate a skew-T chart given generic humidity, temperature, and pressure vectors. (Adapted from code originally found at MIT OpenCourseware)
levfilters: current (5/19/17) version of MATLAB function to filter out given level types from IGRA v1 soundings data.
soundplots: current (5/26/17) version of MATLAB function to chart soundings given a specific time and date.
wnumport: current (5/25/17) version of MATLAB function to create a structure of surface observations data given a raw Mesowest csv file.
yearfilterfs: current (5/19/17) version of MATLAB function to filter out years from a sounding structure.
